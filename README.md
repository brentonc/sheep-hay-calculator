# sheep-hay-calculator
This is the spreadsheet I use to estimate the amount of hay I will need for the upcoming fall/winter/spring.

## Disclaimer
This is simply an estimating tool!  The assumptions and facts must be adjusted for your flock size, situation, nutritional needs, breeds, etc.  

## Instructions:
1) Review Green fields and adjust the assumptions and facts to fit your flock & situation
2) The gray fields are calculated by the spreadsheet
